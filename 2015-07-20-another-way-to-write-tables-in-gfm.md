title: Another way to write tables in GFM
---

This is an entry about [a past entry (Another way to write tables in Markdown)](https://github.com/srph/til/blob/master/2015-02-21-another-way-to-write-tables-in-markdown.md). Funny, because [Markdown's specifications](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) does not include anything related to this syntax:

```
---
title: Something
---
```

I just realized that this is *probably* (lol) due to [GFM (**G**ithub **F**lavored **M**arkup)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) supporting *YAML front matter*, not *Markdown*.

Haha!
