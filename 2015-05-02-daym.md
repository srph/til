title: Relay, Flux, and React. 
---


I’ve been introduced to both [**React**](https://facebook.github.io/react) and [**Flux**](https://facebook.github.io/flux) months ago, but only started to incorporate both in a real-world project recently. One thing I liked about React and Flux is how the views and data are being properly managed; predicting outcome and testability just go so easy. I am bewildered with how data and states are having proper separation of concerns.

Facebook announced [Relay](https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47#What_is_Relay) few months ago. It didn’t make sense for me because I only thought it was a replacement for Flux.

However, as I wade through the tides with Flux, I noticed a few weaknesses along the way. Data-fetching with Flux isn’t so awesome with this hammer, honestly. It also goes to the point that Flux and React crosses each other’s world, when there’s no good reason to. I also noticed how stale the process is, and how it makes me an unproductive developer.

This unproductivity isn’t what I signed up for.

Just now (after a heavy meal for a breakfast) giving it some thought, Flux's primary strength isn't fetching data; it's managing data. Although the majority of examples include data-fetching and API requests, it’s starting to hit me that Flux is crossing another territory that someone has already peed at; it's hammering nails it wasn't supposed to hmamer.

This is where Relay steps in (or peed at, haha).

To put it in summary, *components*, (specifically ones that play as the *container*), handle the requesting of the data, and hydrate the Flux Stores (with the response payload, ofc) afterwards. In a sense, it’s similar to Angular’s resolves.

So for now, it might be a better idea to start writing some of my stuff to the said paradigm. There’s [**react-resolver**](https://github.com/ericclemmons/react-resolver/) anyway (while Relay is still a work in progress), which is an awesome work by [ericclemmons](https://github.com/ericclemmons/).

Honestly, I’m awestruck by this out-of-the-blue idea. Over-eating can sometimes be awesome, haha (no not really, I’ve gotten so unhealthy and attractive and fat now).
