title: Mock you
---

Not long ago, I started [```order-form```](https://github.com/srph/frontend-exercises-order-form-react), and is probably the most tested project I've ever written. Besides being confident it works, it just works. However, since I'm a newbie to software testing, I ```unMocked``` all dependencies (as Jest automatically ```mock```s them) because *YOLO* (nah).

I'm also new to Jasmine (and Jest), and I just found out that mocking allows me to just assume certain *return values* from implementation *X*. ([Jest automatically mocks CommonJS modules returned by ```require()```](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/automatic-mocking.html#content)).

```js
// @rstacruz's sample
// > I'm not super-familiar with jest, but i'd imagine it'd be something like:
describe('when validations succeed', function () {
  beforeEach(function () {
    validator.mockReturnValue(true);
  });

  // ...
});

/* repeat the above here with 'false' instead */
```

\* *See [Jasmine Spies: ```and.returnValue```](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Spies:_<code>and.returnValue</code>).*

This way:

- Provided that ```X``` depends on ```Y```, if ```Y```'s implementation changes and its tests fail, ```X```'s tests won't.
- I avoid an antipattern
- ```X```'s tests are in no way tightly coupled to ```Y```'s implementation.

Pretty neat, huh?
